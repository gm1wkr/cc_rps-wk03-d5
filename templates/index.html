    <h2>Welcome to RPS </h2>
    <p>
        They say Rock Paper Scissors is a game of chance but we here at CodeClan_ Casino think otherwise. Our super
        secret Python algorythms stack the odds in favour of the house.

    <h2>Gameplay</h2>
    <p>
        A classic two-person game. Players start each round by saying, “rock, paper, scissors, shoot!” On “shoot,” each
        player holds out their fist for rock, flat hand for paper, or their index and middle finger for scissors. Rock
        crushes scissors, scissors cut paper, and paper covers rock. See who wins each round!
